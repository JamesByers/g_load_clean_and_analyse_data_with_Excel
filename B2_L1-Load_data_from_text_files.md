In this block we will be using data that is provided in a variety of text file formats.  In this unit we will learn how to import the data from these file types into Excel.

### Lesson objectives

*By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:*
* Describe several types of data transfer files
* Load data text files including CSV, TSV and files with other delimiters
* Set data types on intake

### Pre-work
* If you do not have a version of Excel 2013 or newer on your laptop, install a recent version of Excel onto your laptop.  This typically requires purchasing and installing Microsoft Office or at least the Excel portion
  * Make sure you are installing an laptop version and not an Office 356 version (cloud only)
  * Home and Student version of Microsoft Office is sufficent

## Import data from text files

* Discuss three types of text file formats for storing data - **15 min**
  * Rows and column text files such as CSV and delimited files
  * JSON
  * XML

* Code along - Import a delimited file - **20 min**
  * In a file manager clicking on a .csv file to open it in Excel
    * Successful import
  * Import a less well behaved CSV file by clicking on it 
    * Note defects
    * Moral is you cannot depend on the click import
  * Import using Data > From Text

* Exercise **15 min**
  * Students import a new file using Data > From Text
    * In pairs
    * Import file with:
      * Both enclosing characters and non-comma delimiter
      * Integers that may want to import as text
     * Duplicate (copy) the "raw data tab" to a new tab

* Difference between CSV and delimited files - demo - **15 min**

* Exercise **15 min**
  * Students import a new file using Data > From Text
    * On own for first 7 minutes then in teams of 3
    * Import file with:
      * Both enclosing characters and non-comma delimiter
      * Integers that may want to import as text
    * Duplicate (copy) the "raw data tab" to a new tab
    * Bonus: set a range name for the raw data
      
* Quick look at submitting SQL queries directly from Excel **15 min**
  * Demo functionality
  * Discuss pitfalls (Excel's propensity to format fields)
  * Tour additional resources

* Exercise - **40 min**
Format: work alone for 7 minutes and then in groups of three for 8 minutes for each of the three tasks below
  * Create and submit a query that returns an aggregate table
  * Export the file as a CSV file using delimiters and enclosing characters appropriate to the contents of the fields
     * Note: Aggregate table will contain fields with commas and other issues that will require a delimiter different from comma
  * Import the data into Excel, creating a raw_data tab and and a data tab
