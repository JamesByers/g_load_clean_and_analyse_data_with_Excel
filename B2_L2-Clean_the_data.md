Data can be expected to have a variety of issues that we will want to correct.  By cleaning the raw data we can produce an more usable version of the data.  One that we can analyse accurately.  In this lesson we will learn how to eliminate several types of issues from data.

### Learning Objectives

*By the end of this lesson you will be able to:*
* Communicate why we clean the data
* List 5 techniques we can use to fix numbers, dates and text 
* Apply Excel functions to remove extraneous characters
