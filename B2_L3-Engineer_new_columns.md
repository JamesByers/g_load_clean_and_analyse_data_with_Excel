Previously we have cleaned raw data and created our initial dataset.  Now we we can expand the information we can get from our data by creating new columns derived from existing columns.  In this lesson you will apply Excel functions in folmulas to create new columns in the dataset.

### Learning Objectives
*By the end of this lesson you will be able to:*
* Engineer new columns from existing columns
* Extract substrings from strings
* Create date parts such as quarter, month and week
<br>
<br>

### Extract substrings from existing columns to create new columns - **60 min**                        
#### Code-along - 15 min
  * Extract leading and trailing substrings using LEFT, RIGHT
  * Exract substrings by position/length
<br>

#### Exercise -  15 min 
* work in pairs
* Prepare new columns with substrings extracted from columns
  * LEFT, RIGHT
  * Extract by position/length
<br>

#### Code-along - 15 min
Students complete the actions concurrently with the instructor
* Extract before or after character
* Identify if text contains a substring
<br>

#### Exercise - 15 min
* Work individually and then in groups of three

  * Create columns derived from existing columns 
    * Create year column
    * Create month column
    * Create quarter
    * Create hour column
      * Requires students to search to find solutions in documentation or other resources on the web
