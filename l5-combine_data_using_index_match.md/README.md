## Galvanize Data Analytics
# Combine data sources using Index and Match
#### Block 2 Lesson 5

1.75 hours
<br><br>
We are going to continue to prepare data by fetching and combining data from several spreadsheets into a worksheet

### Learning Objectives
*By the end of this lesson you will be able to:*
* Describe the advantages of INDEX/MATCH over 
* Use INDEX and MATCH to fetch data from another table
<br>

### Combine data from different sources using INDEX/MATCH - 60 min
#### Overview of INDEX/MATCH function - 20 min
* Refer to information in the on-line documentation and search
* Highlight the compute efficiency advantages of INDEX/MATCH over Lookups
  * For larger files it is worth the extra effort to INDEX/MATCH
<br>

#### Code-along with INDEX/MATCH - 30 min
Students complete the actions concurrently with the instructor
* Apply INDEX/MATCH 
  * Load file
  * Create new worksheet
  * Add function to some columns to link to columns in another worksheet
  * Create a new column. Use INDEX/MATCH to fetch the data that matches values in a column
  * Use Lookups to accomplish the same result.  Compare effort vs. efficiency
<br>

#### Exercise: Use INDEX/MATCH to fetch data from other tables - 45 min
* Students work independently and then in teams of three
* Fetch data from other worksheets using lookups
* Requires both horizontal and vertical matches
  * Match numerical values
  * Match string values
  * Handle case where external column has type different from fetching column
